                        <h3>Bridge Construction</h3>
                        <p> Maymodern Group specializes in various types of bridge construction, 
                            leveraging expertise in this essential aspect of civil engineering. 
                            Bridges, integral to the built environment, are pivotal structures 
                            designed based on load-bearing principles, which vary depending on 
                            the type of bridge. Common types include beam, arch, and suspension 
                            bridges, each distinguished by its load-bearing structureâ€”whether 
                            flat, convex, or concave.

                        <h3>Form Work System</h3>
                        <p> A formwork system involves the use of temporary or permanent molds 
                            into which concrete or similar materials are poured during construction. 
                            In concrete construction, falsework supports the shuttering molds, facilitating 
                            the casting of concrete structures.

                        <h3>Steel Structural Fabrication</h3>
                        <p> Steel structural fabrication encompasses the processes of cutting, 
                            bending, and assembling steel to produce a variety of products. 
                            This method involves the joining of multiple steel components to 
                            construct structures of predetermined sizes and shapes, which are 
                            then assembled into buildings, industrial equipment, tools, and various 
                            other final products.

                        <h3>Strutting System</h3>
                        <p> Strutting, also known as timbering or shoring, is a technique utilized 
                            to offer temporary support to the walls of deep trenches or areas 
                            with loose or soft subsoil. This method entails the placement of 
                            timber planks and struts along the trench walls, providing crucial 
                            temporary reinforcement and stability.

                        <h3>Warehouse Construction</h3>
                        <p> The primary distinction between constructing a warehouse and other types 
                            of construction projects lies in their function. A warehouse serves 
                            as a facility for storing items belonging to a company. Depending on 
                            the requirements of the business, a warehouse may need to incorporate 
                            features such as refrigeration, safety measures for storing chemicals, 
                            or other specialized facilities. However, at its core, a warehouse is 
                            designed to fulfill a straightforward function: to securely store inventory 
                            between the stages of manufacturing, transportation, and trading.

                    <div class = "service-col">
                        <div class = "service-img-col">
                            <a href = "#" class = "service-img-link">

                        </div>
                        <h3>Precast Products</h3>
                        <p> Precast concrete is formed by pouring concrete into molds, then 
                            curing it off-site before transport and assembly, often using tilt-up 
                            techniques. Cast-in-place concrete, on the other hand, is poured directly 
                            into on-site forms.
                            <br><br>
                            Precast stone resembles natural stone, achieved by incorporating fine aggregates. 
                            Technology advancements have introduced expanded polystyrene cores in precast 
                            wall panels, enhancing both lightweight construction and energy efficiency in buildings.
